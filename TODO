Things which will be nice to do (after completing the interpreter in first part of the book):
- Decide if we want to require variable initialization
- Make REPL nicer
- Better error handling
- Try to make `;` optional (book has some info on that)
- Experiment with adding a bit of standard library and a module system
- Make "print" a real function instead of a built-in (will require to add simple IO to the interpreter)
