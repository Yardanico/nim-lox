# Nim implementation of Lox interpreter.

"examples" directory contains examples of Lox programs. Some of them might be used
for testing the interpreter later in the future.

Work-in-progress as I read the book.

Completed optional exercises:
- Multiline comments with /* ... */
- Ternary operator `true? "a" : "b"`
- Break statement
- Automatic conversion to string when at least one of arguments is string (addition op)
- Catching division by zero
