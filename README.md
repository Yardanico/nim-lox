# Nim implementation of Lox interpreter.
For more info about Lox see http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/

"examples" directory contains examples of Lox programs. Some of them might be used
for testing the interpreter later in the future.

This interpreter is based on the C implementation of the interpreter in the book.
(There's also an interpreter without classes and inheritance based on Java implementation in the branch ``old``)

Completed optional exercises or stuff which is not in the original language:
